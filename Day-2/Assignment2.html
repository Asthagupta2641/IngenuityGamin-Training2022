                        Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of

                    <li><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues
                        that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable
                        land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying
                        plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the
                        best breeds."</li>
